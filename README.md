Mozilla Monument Name Finder
============================

A quick hack to show where the name of people who helped Mozilla is located on the awesome Mozilla SF monument https://wiki.mozilla.org/Monument. 

You can see it action:

There is also a very plain vanilla version for mobile devices (using appcache to work offline) at:
http://thewebrocks.com/demos/mozilla-monument-name-finder/mobilefinder.html

The dataset was provided by Chris More and is available at https://github.com/chrismore/mozmonument2json

The rotating column was created with http://thewebrocks.com/demos/3D-css-tester/

There is not much to say here, search for your name, find it in a list of names, click it and see where you can find it on the real column. 

Maybe soon:
